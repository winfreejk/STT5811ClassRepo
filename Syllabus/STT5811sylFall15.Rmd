Questions related to ISCAM III materials should be addressed with the [piazza account for STT 5811](https://piazza.com/class/ida59td3ddq3zi). Questions related to *Passion Driven Statistics* materials should be addressed with the [piazza account for STT 2810](https://piazza.com/class/iaawd0uzg2193)   If you send me a class related email, I will remind you to post  questions on the appropriate piazza account.


**Course Description:**  

This course introduces students at the post-calculus level to statistical concepts, applications, and theory. Topics include: comparisons with categorical and numerical data, statistical significance, sampling and sampling distributions, and randomized experiments. Statistical concepts will be developed through simulations, and applications will focus on statistical problem-solving.  Students will complete a semester long research project using principles of reproducible research.  The semester long research project covers data management; descriptive statistics; inferential statistics, including testing one and two sample procedures; ANOVA;  Chi-Square tests; simple regression; and multiple regression.  All of the topics will be  addressed through a student selected research question that will be answered  using one of [six large data sets](https://github.com/alanarnholt/PDS/tree/master/inst/CodeBooks).

**Course Objectives:**

1.  Students will learn how to use a reproducible research work flow.
2.  Students will improve their technology expertise.
3.  Students will learn to work with large data sets.
4.  Students will learn to create and present graphs for both univariate and multivariate data.
5.  Students will learn how to construct and test hypotheses using both classical and randomization approaches.
6.  Students will learn how to construct confidence intervals using both classical and bootstrap approaches.
7.  Students will learn how to generate random and simple random samples and their relationships to permutation and bootstrap distributions.
8.  Students will learn how to work with named sampling distributions (*t*, *F*, binomial, chi-square, hypergeometric, and normal).
9.  Students will learn the scope of inferential conclusions for numerous scenarios (experiments, observational studies, etc.). 


**Course Texts:**

[_Reproducible Research with R and RStudio, Second Edition_](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book) by Christopher Gandrud

[_Investigating Statistical Concepts, Applications, and Methods, Third Edition_ (ISCAMIII)](http://www.rossmanchance.com/iscam3/) by Beth L. Chance and Allan J. Rossman

[_Passion Driven Statistics (Light Weight)_ (PDS)](https://github.com/alanarnholt/PDS-Book) also available on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/arnholt/126376).  

**Course Grading:**

* 30% of the course grade will come from the semester long research project (SLRP).  The semester long research project consists of from 9 peer graded assignments submitted via [CrowdGrader](http://www.crowdgrader.org/).  15% of the SLRP will come from your **Research Proposal**;  15% of the SLRP will be for a poster each student will create and present.  The remaining 20% of the SLRP will be for participation, largely tracked in [piazza](https://piazza.com/class/iaawd0uzg2193).  The participation tracked in piazza includes questions asked on the forum, questions answered on the forum, etc.  

* 30% of the course grade will come from 13 peer graded assignments submitted via [CrowdGrader](http://www.crowdgrader.org/) over ISCAMIII investigations/weekly reflections on reproducible research assignments. 

NOTE: Grading rubrics and directions for all assignments are provided in the directory `CoursePacing` of the class repository. Your grade for a peer evaluated assignment will be a combination of peer evaluations and an evaluation of your peer grading. The algorithm used to compute your grade is explained [in this presentation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxjcm93ZGdyYWRlcm9yZ3xneDozNGIxZGI5YjRiMDIzOTU1).

* 10% of the course grade will be for a midterm exam.

* 10% of the course grade will be for a final exam.

* 10% of the course grade will be for developing/improving PDS assignment rubrics.

* 10% of the course grade will be for participation (largely tracked through piazza).  Each time you come to class, you should hand me a 3 by 5 card before sitting down with your first and last name in the top left, the date in year-month-day format (2015-09-03) in the top right, with at least one question you have about the assigned material for that day, which will also contribute to your participation grade. 


If you know you will be absent at any point in the semester for any reason, please let me know beforehand; and make sure to submit your work via [CrowdGrader](http://www.crowdgrader.org/) before the due date.  

      

**How To Get Unstuck**

If you have a PDS related question, please ask your question on [piazza](https://piazza.com/class/iaawd0uzg2193). All other questions should be addressed on the [STT 5811 piazza account](https://piazza.com/class/ida59td3ddq3zi). Your classmates may have the same question or may answer your question before I can provide an answer.  Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.
